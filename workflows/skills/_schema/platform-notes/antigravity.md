## Antigravity Platform Notes

- Skills are stored under `.agents/skills/<skill-id>/SKILL.md` (shared Agent Skills standard path).
- TOML command files in `.gemini/commands/` provide slash-command entry points for workflows and agent routes.
- Rules file: `.agents/rules/GEMINI.md`.
- Use Agent Manager for parallel agent coordination and multi-specialist delegation (equivalent to `@orchestrator`).
- Specialist routes are compiled into `.gemini/commands/agent-*.toml` command files — not project-local agent markdown.
- Reference files are loaded relative to the skill directory under `.agents/skills/<skill-id>/`.
- MCP skill tools (`skill_search`, `skill_get`, `skill_validate`, `skill_get_reference`) are available when Cubis Foundry MCP is configured.
- User arguments are passed as natural language via `{{args}}` in TOML command prompts.
