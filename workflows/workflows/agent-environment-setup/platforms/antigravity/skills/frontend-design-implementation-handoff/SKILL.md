# Frontend Design Implementation Handoff

## Purpose

Convert the design-engine result into implementation work that matches the repo's real stack and components instead of copying raw generated artifacts.

## When to Use

- After Stitch returns a screen artifact
- After a design screen brief is approved for implementation
- When moving from design state into Flutter, React, or another real UI stack

## Instructions

1. **Prefer existing components and tokens first** — Reuse the repo's real primitives before creating new visual fragments.
2. **Translate semantics, not markup** — A generated artifact is a seed. Rebuild it in the target stack using the same hierarchy and state model.
3. **For Flutter, map into widgets and theme tokens** — Use theme extensions, shared cards, section headers, and navigation widgets instead of porting web structure literally.
4. **Preserve the brief's anti-slop constraints** — Distinctive typography, component rhythm, and motion rules should survive the handoff.
5. **Leave QA hooks behind** — Ensure semantics labels, stable copy, and navigable flows are good enough for `flutter-mobile-qa` or frontend tests.

## Output Format

Deliver:

1. Implementation plan
2. Components/widgets to create or reuse
3. Token/theme mapping
4. QA-readiness notes

## Antigravity Platform Notes

- Skills are stored under `.agents/skills/<skill-id>/SKILL.md` (shared Agent Skills standard path).
- TOML command files in `.gemini/commands/` provide slash-command entry points for workflows and agent routes.
- Rules file relative to the mirrored skill directory: `../../rules/GEMINI.md`.
- Use Agent Manager for parallel agent coordination and multi-specialist delegation (equivalent to `@orchestrator`).
- Specialist routes are compiled into `.gemini/commands/agent-*.toml` command files — not project-local agent markdown.
- Reference files are loaded relative to the skill directory under `.agents/skills/<skill-id>/`.
- MCP skill tools (`skill_search`, `skill_get`, `skill_validate`, `skill_get_reference`) are available when Cubis Foundry MCP is configured.
- User arguments are passed as natural language via `{{args}}` in TOML command prompts.
