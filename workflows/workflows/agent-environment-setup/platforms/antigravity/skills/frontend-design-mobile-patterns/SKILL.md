# Frontend Design Mobile Patterns

## Purpose

Translate the design engine into mobile-specific decisions that survive real Flutter implementation instead of staying as web-first UI ideas.

## When to Use

- Designing Flutter screens, flows, or navigation
- Adapting a Stitch-inspired concept into a mobile-native screen brief
- Reviewing whether a design will survive small screens and thumb-driven interaction

## Instructions

1. **Load `workflows/design-datasets/mobile-patterns.json` first** — Use it to shape navigation placement, card rhythm, CTA placement, and progress visibility.
2. **Design for thumb reach and scroll rhythm** — Primary actions should stay reachable and section breaks should remain scannable on smaller screens.
3. **Prefer Flutter-feasible patterns** — Avoid browser-specific assumptions like hover-led navigation or overly dense freeform layouts that do not translate well to Flutter widgets.
4. **Write implementation cues, not Figma prose** — Specify scaffold usage, navigation model, card rhythm, token usage, and expected widget states.
5. **Feed the result into `frontend-design-implementation-handoff` and `flutter-mobile-qa`** — Mobile design is not complete until implementation and QA can consume the same brief.

## Output Format

Deliver:

1. Mobile-specific layout notes
2. Navigation and CTA placement rules
3. Widget/state expectations
4. Flutter feasibility notes

## Antigravity Platform Notes

- Skills are stored under `.agents/skills/<skill-id>/SKILL.md` (shared Agent Skills standard path).
- TOML command files in `.gemini/commands/` provide slash-command entry points for workflows and agent routes.
- Rules file relative to the mirrored skill directory: `../../rules/GEMINI.md`.
- Use Agent Manager for parallel agent coordination and multi-specialist delegation (equivalent to `@orchestrator`).
- Specialist routes are compiled into `.gemini/commands/agent-*.toml` command files — not project-local agent markdown.
- Reference files are loaded relative to the skill directory under `.agents/skills/<skill-id>/`.
- MCP skill tools (`skill_search`, `skill_get`, `skill_validate`, `skill_get_reference`) are available when Cubis Foundry MCP is configured.
- User arguments are passed as natural language via `{{args}}` in TOML command prompts.
