# Frontend Design System

## Purpose

Author and refresh the project's canonical design-system state so design, Stitch generation, and implementation share the same visual language.

## When to Use

- `docs/foundation/DESIGN.md` is missing or stale
- A new design direction needs to be made durable
- Multi-screen work needs consistent tokens and component vocabulary
- A Flutter/mobile app needs a stable design foundation before implementation

## Instructions

1. **Create or refresh `docs/foundation/DESIGN.md`** — This file is the source of truth for visual direction, token language, component vocabulary, and motion rules.
2. **Write scoped overlays only when needed** — Use the page overlays directory under `docs/foundation/design/pages/`, the flow overlays directory under `docs/foundation/design/flows/`, or the mobile overlays directory under `docs/foundation/design/mobile/` when a narrower slice of the product needs additional detail.
3. **Use semantic token naming** — Load `workflows/design-datasets/token-language.json` and preserve semantic roles instead of raw color dumps.
4. **Preserve source metadata in the authoring process, not the final doc body** — The final design docs should be crisp and implementation-oriented, but the chosen direction should come from normalized datasets with source provenance.
5. **Mirror to `.stitch/DESIGN.md` when Stitch flows are in scope** — The mirror should be generated from the canonical state and applicable overlays, never hand-maintained separately.

## Output Format

Deliver:

1. Canonical design-system summary
2. Token language
3. Component vocabulary
4. Overlay files created or refreshed
5. Whether `.stitch/DESIGN.md` was updated

## Copilot Platform Notes

- Custom agents live under `../../agents/` relative to the mirrored skill directory and use YAML frontmatter such as `name`, `description`, `tools`, `model`, and `handoffs`.
- Agent `handoffs` can guide workflow transitions (for example, `@planner` → `@implementer`).
- Skill files are stored under `.github/skills/` (skill markdown) and `.github/prompts/` (prompt files).
- Path-scoped instructions live under `../../instructions/` and provide file-pattern-targeted guidance via `applyTo` frontmatter.
- User arguments are provided as natural language input in the prompt, not through a `$ARGUMENTS` variable.
- Frontmatter keys `context: fork` and `allowed-tools` are not natively supported; guidance is advisory.
- Reference files can be included via `#file:references/<name>.md` syntax in Copilot Chat.
- MCP configuration lives in `.vscode/mcp.json`. MCP skill tools are available when configured.
- Rules file relative to the mirrored skill directory: `../../rules/copilot-instructions.md` — broad and stable, not task-specific.
