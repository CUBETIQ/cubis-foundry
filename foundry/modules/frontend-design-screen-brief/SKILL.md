# Frontend Design Screen Brief

## Purpose

Produce the compact screen-level brief that downstream tools or engineers can execute without losing the product's visual and interaction intent.

## When to Use

- Preparing a Stitch generation or edit prompt
- Creating a Flutter/mobile screen implementation brief
- Turning a broad design system into a concrete page or flow

## Instructions

1. **Resolve the design state first** — Read `docs/foundation/DESIGN.md` and any relevant overlay before writing the brief.
2. **Describe behavior, not just appearance** — Include hierarchy, interaction states, content priority, empty states, and success/failure feedback.
3. **Keep the prompt compact** — The screen brief should be concise enough for a remote service like Stitch and concrete enough for a human implementer.
4. **Choose platform-specific emphasis** — For Flutter/mobile, emphasize thumb reach, section staging, safe areas, and navigation patterns. For web, emphasize layout elasticity and information density.
5. **Write acceptance constraints** — Explicitly state what must be preserved and what generic shortcuts are not acceptable.

## Output Format

Deliver:

1. Screen goal
2. Hierarchy and layout summary
3. Token and component cues
4. Interaction/motion notes
5. Anti-slop constraints
